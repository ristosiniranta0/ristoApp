Okay, so I'm trying to optimize this JavaScript code. The original line is `export { default } from './transaction-confirmed.container';`. I remember that in ES6 modules, there are different ways to export and import modules. 

The current code is using a named export syntax but exporting the default. Wait, no, actually, it's using the named export for the default. So when you do `export { default }`, you're exporting the default as a named export called 'default'. But if the module being imported only has a default export, maybe there's a simpler way.

I think that if I just use `export * from './transaction-confirmed.container';`, it will re-export all exports from that module. Since in most cases, especially with React components or such files, they might be using a single default export. So by re-exporting everything with `*`, it would include any named exports and also preserve any possible future changes without needing to adjust this line again.

Wait, but does `export *` include both named and default exports? Let me recall: yes, when you use `export * from 'module'`, it imports all exported members (both named and default) and then exports them again as if they were defined in the current module.

So using `export *` simplifies the code because instead of specifically exporting just the default (which could be what's intended), we're just passing along everything exported by that module. This might make maintenance easier because if someone adds more named exports later on without changing this file, those new exports would automatically be available here too.

Another consideration: does this affect how others import from this file? If someone was importing like `import TransactionConfirmed from './file';` expecting only the default export to exist here before optimization, after optimization they would still get TransactionConfirmed as long as that was indeed what was being exported as 'default' in transaction-confirmed.container.

Alternatively, maybe another approach is better: just exporting directly without braces or something else? No waitâ€”since we want to bring all into scope here for re-exporting.

So yeah, replacing with `export *` seems cleaner and more efficient.

The optimized code uses an asterisk (*) which allows for importing all exported members of a module at once instead of specifying each one individually.
 
The updated code is:

```
export * from './transaction-confirmed.container';
