Developer, here's the optimized version of your code:

```python
def optimize_code():
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import numpy as np

    # Function to perform some computation
    def compute(a, b):
        return a + b

    # Creating an array using numpy
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    # Using list comprehension for a cleaner and faster iteration
    result = [compute(x, x*2) for x in arr]

    return result
```

This optimized code creates an array using numpy for efficient computations. Then it uses list comprehension to iterate through the elements of the array and applies a function (in this case `compute`) on each element. The use of list comprehension makes the code cleaner and faster by eliminating explicit loops and reducing the overhead associated with them.
